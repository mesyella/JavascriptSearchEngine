# Javascript Snippet Code Search Engine
Search engine for javascript snippet code. Information Retrieval implementation using TF-IDF and cosine-similarity.

## Database
The data used for this search engine is from 30 seconds of code which consist of 474 javascript snippet code.

## Method
1. Preprocessing text
Preprocessing the data by lowering, remove punctuation and number, and remove stopwords(from the TFIDFVectorizer).
2. TF-IDF
Calculate the Term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency from the data and the input.
3. Cosine Similarity
Find the distance of the input and the data by using cosine similarity and show the shortest distance(nearest).

## Programming Language
The programming language used for this search engine is python. Using some library such as re, string, numpy, and scikit learn.
